            <p class="text-small">Chai, a tea beverage made by boiling black tea in milk and water, with a mixture of aromatic herbs and spices, is loved by one and all in India. This beverage originated in India but now has gained worldwide popularity due to its inherent benefits. We, the Indians, sometimes need no reason to have a cup of tea.Chai, especially in India has become an emotion, synonymous to a healer or a companion. People have become addicted to chai, they can't start a day without having a cup of chai. Many people love drinking coffee, but for some people like me, chai is irreplaceable. </p>
